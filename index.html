      I am <strong> 23 </strong> years old Italian girl based in <strong> Milan </strong>. I am very fascinated about the <strong> luxury </strong> field where I have already worked. I am always in search of stimulating experiences that could implement my creativity and <strong> travelling </strong> is my first passion.
